# 🧮 Merge Sort Visualizer using Tkinter and Matplotlib

This is a Python-based GUI project to **visualize the Merge Sort algorithm** in action using the **Tkinter** library for GUI components and **Matplotlib** (though unused in this script and can be removed) for potential future animations. It generates a random array and displays the sorting process step-by-step, using colored bars to help understand how Merge Sort works internally.

## 🚀 Features

- Visual representation of Merge Sort
- Random array generation
- Adjustable sorting speed using a slider
- Color-coded sorting process:
  - 🟡 Yellow: Elements in the left half
  - 🟠 Orange: Elements in the right half
  - 🔵 Blue: Unsorted/untouched elements

## 🧰 Technologies Used

- Python 3
- Tkinter (GUI)
- Matplotlib (Imported, not used — you can safely remove it or use it for extended visualization)
- Random
- Time

---

## ▶️ How to Run
- Click **Generate Array** to create a random list.
- Use the **slider** to set the speed of visualization.
- Click **Start Merge Sort** to begin the sorting visualization.

## 📚 How It Works

The core of this project lies in:

- **Merge Sort Algorithm**: Implemented recursively, with each merge operation visualized.
- **Canvas Drawing**: Visual elements are rectangles drawn on a canvas representing array elements.
- **Color Mapping**: Helps understand which part of the array is being worked on.

## 🛠️ Future Improvements

- Add other sorting algorithms (Bubble, Quick, Insertion, etc.)
- Add Matplotlib animation support (for exporting to GIFs/videos)
- Improve UI/UX and responsiveness
- Add sound effects for educational enhancement
